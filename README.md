Based on directions from the course instructors ( ,,The engine so advanced it's Unreal" BEST course), with established assets, I created two projects :
- The room - project focuses to create photorealistic environment of a room 
- Game - project focuses to design a battle arena and implement basic character movement with Blueprint)
